## v0.5.2 (2026-10-11)

### Changed

- **k-anonymity warns instead of refusing.** A PII filter, group or
  aggregate that covers fewer than `limits.k_anonymity` rows is no longer
  refused after approval with `E_K_ANON`. The counts now run before the
  approval prompt, and each count under k adds a `▲ k-anonymity` warning
  to the approval frame, just above `Approve? [y/N]`: the statement could
  single out one person or infer a masked value by cross-checking. You
  decide: `y` runs it, `n` denies it as usual. In auto mode the statement
  runs, and the warning is printed in its frame and kept in the audit
  record's `warnings`. A count that cannot run warns the same way.
- The agent learns nothing of the counts: no refusal code, the same answer
  whether a count is under k or not, and in auto mode a response time
  levelled from the counts on. Row estimates stay hidden under a PII filter.
- The structural PII rules are unchanged: equality only on PII columns, no
  `LIKE`, range or negation, masking, cell references and placeholders still
  refuse as before.
- `E_K_ANON` is retired. No refusal carries it; it stays a known code so
  that `locksql stats` still counts it in older audit logs. The MCP server
  instructions and the agent instructions written by `locksql init` no
  longer say that a k-anonymity refusal is final: rerun `locksql init` to
  refresh them.
- [docs/security-model.md](docs/security-model.md) now describes
  k-anonymity as a decision aid for the human, not a guarantee.
